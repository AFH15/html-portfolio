<h1>My Favourite Anime Series</h1>
<h2>Top 3 anime series of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Spirited away (千と千尋の神隠し)</h3>
<p>This is the first anime that I ever Watched, 
    so it is so nostalgic for me.</p>
<h3>Attack on Titan (進撃の巨人)</h3>
<p>This anime is making me start to look into
     Japanese culture in a deeper perspective</p>
<h3>Sword art online (ソードアートオンライン)</h3>
<p>This might be one of the anime that motivates me to study
    in Japan in technological field. 
    The concept of virtual world really fascinated me!
